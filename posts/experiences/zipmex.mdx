- Created new UI components and styled them to match the **Figma** designs for trading/investment-related pages in order to support website revamp and light theme release
- Refactored old, individually-styled UI components into reusable, standardized **React**/**Material-UI** components to make the website look more consistent
- Improved code quality and debugged underlying issues by adding more type inference to **React** and **Redux** code using **TypeScript**
