- Refactored old, individually-styled UI components into standardized **React**/**Material-UI** components that can be
reused across pages to make website look more consistent
- Improved code quality by debugging newly-discovered issues arising from adding stronger type inference with
**TypeScript** to **React** and **Redux** code
- Supported the website revamp and light theme release by fixing UI components and styling them to match the new
**Figma** designs for trading/investment-related pages
- Wrote test cases for new pages using **Jest**
